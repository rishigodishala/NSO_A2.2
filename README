 NSO_A2.2 — Ansible Deployment of Flask App with HAProxy & Nginx

This project automates the deployment of a simple Flask web service across multiple servers, with HAProxy load balancing, Nginx reverse proxy, and SNMP monitoring, using Ansible.

---

 Project Overview
- Webservers (`devA`, `devB`, `devC`):
  - Run a simple Flask app (`application2.py`) via Gunicorn.
  - Each request returns the server’s hostname, IP, and current time.
  - Useful for testing load balancing.

- HAProxy Host:
  - Balances traffic across all webservers using **round-robin**.
  - Config is generated dynamically from Ansible inventory.

- Nginx:
  - Acts as an additional reverse proxy on the HAProxy host.

- SNMP:
  - Installed on all hosts for monitoring.

---

Deployment Steps:
 1.Clone repository:
 2.Ensure you can SSH into all hosts:
 3.Run the playbook:
   ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yaml

 HAProxy will now distribute requests across devA, devB, and devC.

Testing
 - Access the HAProxy node’s public IP:
   http://<HAproxy_IP>/
 - Refresh multiple times → you should see responses rotating between devA, devB, and devC.
